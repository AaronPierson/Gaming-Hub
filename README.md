# Gaming-Hub
 
This is a public build version of my gamers hub app using Xamarin, C#, Azure it's a cross-platform app for gamers. It accesses the largest gaming database and searches for any game you know. View the latest and upcoming games, and save games for viewing later.

I will be expanding this in the future as a native android app and website while adding tons of new features. it's not meant to replace other sites gamers use but to compliment them if they use other sites.
