# Gaming-Hub
 
This is a public build version of my gamers hub app using Xamarin, C#, Azure it's a cross-platform app for UWP and Android app. 

Gamers Hub allows users to search for games then view all the info on them. The info gets pulled from RAWG Video Games Database, but I allows users to save their games in a local database for offline viewing using SQLite. I also created a CMS and website for people that would like to join and create news articles generated by the team (me).

One of the issues that I faced was development time and compatibility using Xamarin to make both apps save a lot of time. As the project got more complex and the compatibility between the two got further apart it was hard to develop them both at the same time. Also, not currently in the released build Iâ€™ve added a google firebase Auth to my app. After that, the plan was to integrate different social apps to allow for sharing and posting.
